Minimum Viable Product:

User can signup/login using email, or do so through facebook.

User can access database of Restaurants. Can add a restaurant if it is not already there.

User can choose from category of Pizza Type (Neapolitan, NY-Style, etc)

User can add pies to database, and edit/update them. Can they delete? Don't want them deleting record from everyone.

User can add restaurants to database, edit and update them. Cannot delete them.

User can rate restaurant & add pies to restaurant review that they've eaten. NO REVIEW of individual pies. Not necessary.

User can then filter what restaurants they have rated, and see those ratings.

Ex:
Restaurant Review:

- rate ambiance
- rate service
- rate food

Then choose from an existing list of pizza's offered:

What Pies did you eat? Rating of pie is under restaurant review. - NO. User can review the pie under restaurant rating itself.

- Plain Pie
- Pepperoni Pie etc.

Reach goals:

User can filter Restaurants by neighborhood and borough -- EXTRA REACH, not necessary to fulfill project requirements.

To Do:
Check that code is DRY.
Limited logic in controllers.
Check activerecord level scope (does it fulfill?) X (Two scope methods, for borough, and for user_id.)

What about restaurants with more than one location?
